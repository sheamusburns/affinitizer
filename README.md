# affinitizer
A simple automated clicker chrome extension for adding and removing 'group' members on Blackbaud's onCampus module manager pages. The way blackbaud makes you do this is by clicking on the items one at a time. No way to do it batch. This little tool looks through the HTML, finds all the items that need to be clicked on, and then autonomously does so, one at a time -- click, load, click, load, etc. Be careful though -- when you run the process, you need to wait until it's finished it's all done clicking and loading.
